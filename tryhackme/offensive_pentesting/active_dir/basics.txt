Active dir is dir service for Windows Domain Networks.

USE: The majority of large companies use Active Directory because it allows for the control and monitoring of their user's computers through a single domain controller. It allows a single user to sign in to any computer on the active directory network and have access to his or her stored files and folders in the server, as well as the local storage on that machine. This allows for any user in the company to use any machine that the company owns, without having to set up multiple users on a machine.

Physical Active Directory
The physical Active Directory is the servers and machines on-premise, these can be anything from domain controllers and storage servers to domain user machines; everything needed for an Active Directory environment besides the software.

Domain Controllers: 
A domain controller is a Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest. Domain controllers are the center of Active Directory -- they control the rest of the domain. I will outline the tasks of a domain controller below: 
holds the AD DS data store 
handles authentication and authorization services 
replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest
Allows admin access to manage domain resources

AD DS Data Store - 
The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:
Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
accessible only by the domain controller
That is everything that you need to know in terms of physical and on-premise Active Directory. Now move on to learn about the software and infrastructure behind the network.
