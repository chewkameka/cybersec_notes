Get-Command
Get-Help [command name] -examples
Get-Command gets all the cmdlets installed on the current Computer. The great thing about this cmdlet is that it allows for pattern matching like the following

Creating Objects From Previous cmdlets

One way of manipulating objects is pulling out the properties from the output of a cmdlet and creating a new object. This is done using the Select-Object cmdlet. 

Here's an example of listing the directories and just selecting the mode and the name:

When retrieving output objects, you may want to select objects that match a very specific value. You can do this using the Where-Object to filter based on the value of properties. 
Verb-Noun | Where-Object -Property PropertyName -operator Value
Verb-Noun | Where-Object {$_.PropertyName -operator Value}

The second version uses the $_ operator to iterate through every object passed to the Where-Object cmdlet.

Where -operator is a list of the following operators:

-Contains: if any item in the property value is an exact match for the specified value
-EQ: if the property value is the same as the specified value
-GT: if the property value is greater than the specified value


Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped

When a cmdlet outputs a lot of information, you may need to sort it to extract the information more efficiently. You do this by pipe lining the output of a cmdlet to the Sort-Object cmdlet.

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *interesting-file.txt* -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Get-Content [filename]
Get-Content "C:\Program Files\interesting-file.txt.txt"
